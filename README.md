## Code work for Strain CGMD
  Nonlinear bending motion of single walled carbon nanotubs(SWCNT) which has published in PRB (Koh et al., PRB 2015) has depicted using simple beads system.
  
  
#### Simulation model
- SWNT (5,5) at 300 K
- one end fixed as 0 K
- Total time duration : 0.25 ns
- Results in animated GIF

![SegmentLocal](Short_version.gif "segment")

- Left : 5 times amplified MD simulation 
- Right : 15 times amplified UA 60 in CGMD simulation
- CGMD simulation shares the initial displacement and velocity only with that of MD simulation
