## Code work for Strain CGMD
  Nonlinear bending motion of single walled carbon nanotubs(SWCNT) calculated using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation using cantilevered SWCNT (Koh et al., PRB 2015) has depicted using coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD), which is modeled as a simple beads system.
  
  
#### Simulation model
- SWNT (5,5) at 300 K
- one end fixed as 0 K
- Total time duration : 0.25 ns
- Results in animated GIF: nonlinear motion calculated by CGMD and MD simulation
- CGMD simulation shares the initial displacement and velocity only with that of MD simulation

- Left : 5 times amplified MD simulation 
- Right : 15 times amplified UA 60 in CGMD simulation
